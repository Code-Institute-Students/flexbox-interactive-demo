An interactive widget to help [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) students understand flex-shrink. The website features:
- three inputs
- a result output which visually shows the result
- box stats on the calculated values.

The primary goal of this application is for users to have a clear understanding of flex-shrink values and how they interact.

The business goals of this application are:
* Build brand credibility
* Improve student satisfaction with the CSS Essentials module
* Improve student velocity through the Flexbox section of the CSS Module
* Improve student velocity through their projects and beyond

The student goals for this application are:
* Build a stronger understanding of how flex-shrink works and how it interacts with the parent.
* Build confidence in how to approach coding the different flex-shrink values
* Clear, easy to understand content
* Due to the starting size of the parent, we recommend screens of 600px wide at minimum.

This website is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

## UX

#### Ideal Client
##### The Ideal Client for this application is:
* English speaking

##### Visitors to this website are searching for:
* A better understanding of the Flexbox properties, particularly flex-shrink
* An interactive way to learn about flex-shrink and its mechanisms
* A clear explanation of the overall concept

##### This project is the best way to help them achieve this things because:
* On researching we were not able to find any application that already provides an interactive tool for teaching the flex-shrink concept
* The User Interface is clean and simple to use
* The text-based part of the lesson is clear and concise
* The provided image helps visualize the concept
